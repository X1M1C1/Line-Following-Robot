# Line-Following-Robot
Final Project for Embedded Operating Systems course. We will implement a line following robot by using an Rpi, servormotors, a chassis and some wheels. 
In order to start our robot we simply ssh into our Rpi, input the dimensions of the grid we want to traverse, the starting and destination node indexes, the initial orientation of the robot with regards to the grid "forward", "right", "backward", "left" and then execute the robot_control.py file.
